          <h3>What is past perfect Tense?</h3>
          <p>
          The past perfect tense is slightly different in its structure and use in a sentence from the simple past tense and the past continuous tense.
          The past perfect tense clearly states that one action took place before another action in the past. It can also be said that the past perfect tense represents a past action that took place in the past.
          Now, take a look at the definitions of the past perfect tense given by various dictionaries.

        <h3>Using the Past Perfect Tense â€“ Points to Remember</h3>
        <p>The past perfect tense is similar to the present perfect tense in its structure. Like the present perfect tense, the past perfect tense also employs a helping verb (had) and the past participle of the main verb.
          The only difference is that the past perfect tense uses the same helping verb â€˜hadâ€™ irrespective of the first, second or third pronoun being used as the subject.
          Past participles of regular verbs are usually the same as the past form, whereas most irregular verbs take different spellings when used in the past form and the past participle form. 
          If you know the past participles correctly, you will not find any difficulty with understanding or employing the past perfect tense in your writing and speech.</p>

        â€¢ To denote the time until a certain point in the past.<br/>
