        <h3>Rules to be Followed when Using the Past Perfect Continuous Tense</h3>
        <p>Similar to the present perfect continuous tense, the past perfect continuous tense also consists of two helping verbs and a main verb. 
          Among the three verbs that represent the tense, the first helping verb should always be â€˜hadâ€™ followed by â€˜beenâ€™, which is in turn followed by the present participle of the main verb. 
          This rule holds true when the sentence is a positive sentence. In case you are employing the tense form in an interrogative sentence, 
          the helping verb â€˜hadâ€™ comes first followed by the subject which is in turn followed by the the helping verb â€˜beenâ€™ and the present participle of the main verb.
          For a negative sentence, â€˜notâ€™ is placed after the first auxiliary verb â€˜hadâ€™ and for a negative interrogative sentence, you can either use the contraction â€˜hadnâ€™tâ€™ or place â€˜notâ€™ after the subject.</p>
